                    System or any third party, (ii) may adversely impact the System or any other Illusory client,

                    the System or Service as described in Section 7.; (b) the Client is in breach of any representation
                    or warranty found in this Agreement or any other representation and warranties provided to Illusory

                    law rules, and the courts of Tel-Aviv-Jaffa shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the parties.</p>
                <p>10.4 If any provision of this Agreement will be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                    contrary to any law, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect as if said
                    provision never existed.</p>
                <p>10.5 No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right, power or remedy
                    hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.</p>
                <p>10.6 Illusory may, at any time, and at its sole discretion, modify this Agreement, with or without
                    notice to the Client. Any such modification will be effective immediately upon public posting.
                    Client&#x27;s continued use of the Systems and Service following any such modification constitutes
