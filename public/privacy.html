                        includes your IP address, and email address, screen name, payment and billing information or
                        other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the on-boarding process
                        and services provisioning. In some cases, we may record audio or video calls with you, in order
                        to comply with User compliance evaluation requirements we are subject to and our internal
                        guidelines. When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your
                        credentials with a designated third party website or service (&quot;Third Party Account&quot;)
                        such as Gmail®. Doing so will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If
                        you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to
                        approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will
                        obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your Third Party Account,
                        such as user-name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences. Any
                        Anonymous Information that is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is
                        treated by us as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.
                    </li>
                    <li>Registering through social network account: When you register or sign-in to the Services via
                        your social network account (e.g., Facebook, Google+), we will have access to basic information
                        from your social network account, such as your full name, home address, email address,
                        birthdate, profile picture, friends list, personal description, as well as any other information
                        you made publicly available on such account or agreed to share with us. At all times, we will
                        abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of the social network platform.

                <h3>Information we share</h3>

                <p>We may also share your Personal Information and other information in special cases if we have good
                    reason to believe that it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law, regulation, subpoena, or court
                    order; (2) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, violation of our policies or
                    technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other agreements between

                <h3>Processing of data outside the EEA</h3>
                <p>Note that some data recipients may be located outside the EEA. In such cases, we will share your data
                    only with recipients located in such countries as approved by the European Commission as providing
                    an adequate level of data protection or enter into legal agreements ensuring an adequate level of
                    data protection.</p>
                <h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>We use industry-standard information, security tools, and measures, as well as internal procedures
                    and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse and data leakage. Our employees are subject to
                    confidentiality obligations. We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of
                    data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If you become aware
                    of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately.
                    We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as
                    required.</p>
                <h3>Your Choices and Rights</h3>
                <p>We strive to give you ways to update your information quickly or to delete it – unless we have to
                    keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal
                    information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</p>
                <p>If you are a resident of California, United States, you have the right to send us a written request
                    regarding a list of Personal Information categories that we may have disclosed to third parties or
                    to which we may have given to third parties, and the details of such third parties.</p>
                <p>If you are a resident of the European Union, note that the following rights specifically apply
                    regarding your personal information: (1) Receive confirmation as to whether or not personal
                    information concerning you is being processed, and access your stored personal information, together
                    with supplementary information; (2) Receive a copy of personal information you directly volunteer to
                    us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format; (3) Request rectification of your

                    and regulatory requirements.</p>
                <p>To exercise such right, you may contact us at: support@illusory.io</p>
                <h3>Retention</h3>
                <p>We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, and as
                    necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies. Under
                    applicable regulations, we will keep records containing client personal data, account opening
                    documents, communications, and anything else as required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                    discretion.</p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>When you use our Site, we may store cookies on your computer (as well as other tracking technologies
                    like web beacons and pixels) in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Site. A cookie is
                    a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer&#x27;s hard drive (if your web
                    browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies may store
                    information regarding your account information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your
                    browser permits, but such disabling may cause some of the features of our Site to not operate
                    properly and your online experience may be limited.</p>
                <p>We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about your use of the Site.
                    Google&#x27;s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits
                    to this Site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h3>Information Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we are not responsible for the accuracy, correctness,
                    and security of any of the information we gather, store, and disclose to you or anyone else.</p>
                <p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent
                    you disclose your information to other parties or sites throughout the internet, different rules may
                    apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage
                    you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party that you choose to
                    disclose information.</p>

                    limitation through acquisition, merger, or sale, we reserve the right to transfer all or part of the
                    Personal Information and Anonymous Information we store in our systems. You acknowledge that in the
                    event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership, we may have no control over the use and transfer
                    of your personal information.</p>
                <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>This Policy may be revised from time to time at our sole discretion, so check it regularly. The last
                    revision will be reflected in the &quot;Last Updated&quot; heading. Any change of this policy will
                    be posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Services following any such changes will be
                    considered as your consent to the amended Privacy Policy.</p>
