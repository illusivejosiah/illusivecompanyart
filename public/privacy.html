                        includes your IP address, and email address, screen name, payment and billing information or
                        other information we may ask from time to time as will be required for the on-boarding process
                        and services provisioning. In some cases, we may record audio or video calls with you, in order
                        to comply with User compliance evaluation requirements we are subject to and our internal
                        guidelines. When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your
                        credentials with a designated third party website or service (&quot;Third Party Account&quot;)
                        such as GmailÂ®. Doing so will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If
                        you choose this option, a Third Party Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to
                        approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will
                        obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your Third Party Account,
                        such as user-name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences. Any
                        Anonymous Information that is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is
                        treated by us as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.
                    </li>
                    <li>Registering through social network account: When you register or sign-in to the Services via
                        your social network account (e.g., Facebook, Google+), we will have access to basic information
                        from your social network account, such as your full name, home address, email address,
                        birthdate, profile picture, friends list, personal description, as well as any other information
                        you made publicly available on such account or agreed to share with us. At all times, we will
                        abide by the terms, conditions and restrictions of the social network platform.

                    an adequate level of data protection or enter into legal agreements ensuring an adequate level of
                    data protection.</p>
                <h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
                <p>We use industry-standard information, security tools, and measures, as well as internal procedures

                    confidentiality obligations. We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of
                    data misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If you become aware
                    of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately.
                    We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>When you use our Site, we may store cookies on your computer (as well as other tracking technologies
                    like web beacons and pixels) in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Site. A cookie is
                    a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer&#x27;s hard drive (if your web
                    browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies may store
                    information regarding your account information. You are always free to decline our cookies if your
                    browser permits, but such disabling may cause some of the features of our Site to not operate
                    properly and your online experience may be limited.</p>

                <p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent
                    you disclose your information to other parties or sites throughout the internet, different rules may
                    apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage
                    you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party that you choose to
                    disclose information.</p>
